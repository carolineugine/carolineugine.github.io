# Eugine Caroline Shin
<br>
I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). I am currently in [INSPIRE@OhioState](https://www.sites.google.com/view/inspire-ohiostate) working with [Dr.Aylin Yener](https://u.osu.edu/yener.5/).

My research focus is in Theoretical Machine Learning, specifically on Federated Learning, Optimization, and Fairness.  

Prior to OSU, I have received my undergraduate degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from [Chung-Ang University](https://neweng.cau.ac.kr/index.do), Seoul, Korea.
